# About Me

## Introduction

Hello! I'm an Electronic Engineer with a passion for hardware design and software development. Over the past decade, I've specialized in working with microcontroller ARM and AVR-based systems, delivering successful projects ranging from educational initiatives to home and office security solutions.

## Programming Expertise

My programming journey began with QBASIC, but I quickly embraced C/C++ as my primary language. Today, I leverage my extensive C/C++ knowledge for developing Windows and Linux projects. This experience has provided me with invaluable insights into the interplay between hardware and software, empowering me to design robust systems and efficiently debug code, including assembly-level programming when necessary.

## Versatile Skill Set

My enthusiasm for learning and the diverse requirements of various projects led me to explore a wide range of languages and technologies. My repertoire includes expertise in Basic, C/C++, Visual C/C++, Qt, PHP, JavaScript, Java, Assembly, Perl, Python, and more.

## Open-Source Contributions

I am proud to contribute to the open-source community and maintain an active portfolio on GitHub (http://www.github.com/ehsan.ecc). Feel free to explore my projects, star your favorites, and engage with the code!
